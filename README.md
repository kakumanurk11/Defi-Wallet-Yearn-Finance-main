# Defi-Wallet-Yearn-Finance
Defi Wallet:
Yearn Finance:
With Yearn finance you send your tokens to their smart contract, and they automatically forward your tokens to the Defi protocol with the highest interest rate. It is all automatic.
We build a wallet that invests in the best Defi protocol by using Yearn finance
compound, DYDX, Aave
Example:
you send Dai token to YDai smart contract you will receive YDai tokens showing you have invested in Yearn protocol
YDAI will send DAI to Defi Protocol like Aave, DYDX, and compound to earn interest. YDAI smart contract receives liquidity provider tokens. in case of the compound, the smart contract gets CDAI from the compound. 

Will send DAI to the smart contract of the wallet, and the wallet will forward the DAI  to the YDAI smart contract. Every Dai you send to the wallet automatically ends up in Defi protocols and will start earning the interest on it.

When we want to withdraw, the wallet will send back the YDAI token to YDAI smart contract then YDAI smart contract will send back the DAI. Finally, the wallet will send Dai to the owner's address.

Advantage:
if you want to withdraw 100 DAI, the wallet automatically withdraws all the DAI that we have invested and sends 100 DAI to you. If any DAI is left in the wallet, it will reinvest the remaining DAI in yearn finance.
All these happen in a single transaction
Another advantage is you no need to know the Defi protocol .Wallet will do this automatically finding the best Defi protocol that returns more interest for you.
